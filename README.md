# bookmarklets
A collection of javascripts I can call with a single bookmarklet

The script that has to be stored as a bookmarklet is in `scripts/bookmarklet.js`. This can be minified using `https://www.minifier.org/`. 

When you add a script, save the file in the appropriate folder and add it to `config.json` for discovery.
